# bubbleboxer ðŸ¥Š - compose bubbles into boxes ðŸ“¦

A way to compose multiple [bubbles](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbles) into one layout.

To layout the bubbles with bubbleboxer, one would construct a layout-tree ðŸŒ².
Each node holds a arbitrary amount of children as well as the orientation (horizontal/vertical) and the spacing of them.
Each leaf is linked (via an address) to one Model which satisfies the [bubbletea](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea) Model-interface.
With this address one can access this Models and change them independently from the layout-tree.
